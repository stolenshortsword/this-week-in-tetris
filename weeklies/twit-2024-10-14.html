<h2>Classic Tetris League</h2>

<p>Intro</p
A fresh season of CTL means new divisional draws and another chunk of league play to bless us with regular games and matchups reglected by other formats. Subdivisions have slightly contracted to 8 players each, and welcomes back championship semifinalists dog, Scuti, Myles and Sodium. Although Tristop, Sidnev and DanV won’t be returning, they’re replaced by comparably strong contenders in Alex T, SV and meme. CRTs are unfortunately prohibited in Portal’s university dorm, so we say goodbye to him, although CIS compatriot nek0 stays on to prove he’s worthy of Ryan Hamburger’s hype. Although Masy and Tugi avoided relegation, they’re sitting out to make room for perennial CTM challenger fur_of_kitten and veteran Jerpi, who won Div. 2 in season 25.  Last season’s Division 2 promotions see TetrisTime and Redshurt enter Div. 1 to prove themselves. And of course Cobra, iBall, Coalbucket and Rahmations all retained their spots finishing by middle-of-the-pack in season 26 league play. 

Note that initially there was a play in between HydrantDude and Curi for the last Div. 1 spot, but was eventually given back to Rahmations due to a misunderstanding about registration. The play-in never actually happened as scheduled because Curi’s electricity was unreliable, so how serendipitous. Both Hydrant and Curi stay in Div. 2.

Divisions are drawn via splitting pools of players organized by their CTL results for a fairer skill distribution, although a subdivision of death is the result it seems. 1B lands both #1 contenders Alex and Scuti, whilst 1A’s equivalents are dog and Myles.  1B has iBall and Nek0, 1A has Meme and SV. 1B has Sodium and Rahmations, 1A has Coalbucket and Cobra. While the Div. 2 promotees on 1A side (kitten and TTime) seem to have an edge over Jerpi and Redshurt, I think I’m taking the rest of 1B’s head-to-head matchups every time if we were to order by strength. And as a crude quantification, 1A’s players have 1582 total Premiere Poll votes between them; 1B has 2007.

Rahmations’s last-minute CTL registration was especially timely given his rank in the Premiere Poll has been slipping due to inactivity, having been absent since his fourth place at MinneD.  Although he put up a respectable fight against Dengler in Gauntlet, another chance to prove that it was a pattern, not a fluke (on a bigger stage) can’t hurt. He’s challenged by veteran Jerpi, who returns to competition for the first time since CTWC 2024, coupling this set with a stab at CTM Challengers. Her one-handed roll grip continues to mesmerize and confuse, including caster roncli who is bewildered at her killscreen play after thinking she was playing DAS (or thortapping).
<p></p>
The set itself is a little less exciting than the stories of its competitors. Rah throws down hefty 19 and 29 transition scores; although he tops out immediately on the killscreen, Jerpi doesn’t do much better and fails to chasedown the difference between their pre-29 scores. She then early tops the subsequent two games before 65 lines, perhaps showing her rust in getting 5 taps to the left. Rahmations takes the set in a sweep, his mullen topping out on level 24 doesn’t help punctuate things.

Dog is trying to pull away from the pack of Sidnev, Myles and Tristop as his rebirth run puts the current Tetris order into question. His run to the finals in Masters although fell short, was hardly disappointing stat-wise (1.473m FMS!) still kept Scuti as the tentative #1 in a lot of people’s eyes. New-look Coalbucket himself is attempting to push into the top 15, with all the momentum in the world. 
<p></p>
Game 1 certainly lived up to these lofty expectations: a double rollover. Both were pacing hard; but Coal just paced harder through 18, throwing down a near 700k transition and pushed hard for the 1.3 into-29, even pulling off 2 delayed VITSes to max on 24, at one point amassing a 200k+ lead. Dog seemed content to let his killscreen play do the work, because whilst Coal had to deal with a perpetually messy board from squeezing out every last point from the slower speeds, dog just piled on the points as the level scaled his tetris values. Coal absolutely did not let up, but even when he rolled over, dog had already done so in fewer lines. He knew the mission. Dog would mullen another 100k to put up a spooky high 1.7 million. Roncli has said he felt the momentum already slipping away, and Coal, seemingly winded couldn’t manage a maxout in the following 2 games, even after a 100k lead at transition in game 3. Dog made his supremacy known by mullening out another 1.7 million by pacing hard through the killscreen.

Alex marks the end of his well-deserved break from competition (excluding a tapover in Basement Battles and gaunlet) by returning to CTL. It’ll be an important season in proving he deserves his spot at #1 after a handful of pollsters felt his defeat to Scuti was convincing. iBall also took September off, and with the top 10 being so competitive his games, especially against rising star Nek0, will be ones to watch.
<p></p>
Huh. Alex cannot get into scoring position on the killscreen and an empty left spells the end. iBall coasts to a 1 game lead. They trade leads of less than 2 tetrises throughout game 2, until level 36 where a dig up high for Alex puts him in a 4 tetris deficit that his 29 aggression doesn’t repay. In fact, it just looks like recklessness that makes him top out. And whilst iBall also tops out on level 31 due to a spire, his pre-29 cleanliness gives him a 2 game lead. Filled with confidence, iBall goes shirtless. Alex says in chat he wants too also, but its too cold and he needs to keep his sweater on. That was his first mistake. Shirtless iBall, unanswered too, gives off a dangerous aura and Alex tops out at 91 lines. In an elimination game. A man with the highest Masters F19% of 96.7%. Alex said he wasn’t warmed up — and maybe that, in combination with the rust of a break and the expectations of a return meant losing in a sweep, and not a pretty one at that.

iBall denies Sodium the reverse sweep on his campaign back to the CTL playoffs for the first time since season 23. Both had a mediocre games and an early topout, but it was iBall’s dominant opening 1.4 that set the tone and made the difference.
